    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="muted"><em>Last updated: December 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the
      <strong>Ontario G1 Practice Test</strong> website and app (“the Service”).
      By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      Ontario G1 Practice Test provides online practice questions, explanations, and related study material
      to help users prepare for the Ontario G1 knowledge test. The Service is for educational and personal
      use only.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Official Affiliation</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is <strong>not</strong> affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the
      Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), DriveTest, or any government agency.
      All practice questions are original and created for educational purposes only.
      The Official MTO Driver’s Handbook is used solely as a reference.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction or have permission from a parent or
      legal guardian to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent that this is the case.
    </p>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>When using the Service, you agree that you will:</p>

      Access to the full Service is offered on a subscription basis, currently at
      <strong>$15 CAD per month</strong> (unless otherwise stated on the website).
      All prices are subject to change, but any change will apply to future billing cycles only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Payments are processed securely through Stripe.
      By starting a subscription, you authorize Stripe to charge your payment method on a recurring basis
      until you cancel.

      We offer a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong>. If you are not satisfied or did not pass
      your test within 30 days of subscribing, you may request a full refund. We reserve the right to ask
      for basic information to verify your request, but we aim to keep this process simple and fair.
    </p>

    <h2>7. No Guaranteed Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      While we strive to provide accurate and helpful preparation material, we cannot guarantee that you will
      pass the G1 knowledge test or achieve any particular result. Your success depends on your own effort,
      study habits, and understanding.
