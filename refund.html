    <p>
      This guarantee applies as long as the refund request is submitted within
      <strong>30 days from the original purchase date</strong>.

      We will make every reasonable effort to resolve the issue promptly.

      <li>Failure to use the Service without a technical reason</li>
      <li>Violation of our Terms of Use</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>
      All payments are processed securely through <strong>Stripe</strong>.
      Approved refunds will be issued back to the original payment method whenever possible.
      Processing times may vary depending on your bank or card issuer.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Refund Policy</h2>

      We may update this Refund Policy from time to time.
